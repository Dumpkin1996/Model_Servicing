asked a question
you know the juicy
water at what you think of the water
i'm gonna start out by think i've seen a lot of chinese movie and they're usually just very average you know varied for the acting is for
why
wandering earth is fantastic
it's wonderful

to let the hell was that
the wondering where it is the best chinese movie i have ever seen or at least in a very long time right course there's the classic of the wandering earth was an awesome
movie
where at
i had at that
wonder if that patch it
at least is you
and ah
the end viewed
what did what was that my thought
in adventure and i says what
it's a tough too
rama
but of late
wandering are
didn't read movie
wandering earth
was easily the best chinese movie i've seen in a long time but i didn't talk to him and asked them if they thought this is a good movie
that well but i see it within the first ten minutes of sitting there
i realize that this movie was going to be different this movie wasn't just going to be average the movie looks amazing then
was interesting
and from the very beginning it actually did we end
i thought wow this is kind of neat story because i assumed that it would just be the same
typical world in the story that we've seen a million times but in fact he was gone
really well
honestly it's many times and chinese movies this thing happens with the acting is unbelievable you can tell that they're acting it's just not that good
this movie
the exception at a hotel but
i have
in this moving there is real drama is real action and is actually really good things
and
the only thing that i can think of that i didn't like about this movie is probably the fact that it seemed a little national it's it was a little chinese that the the kind of
wish this narrative of no one can save the world except for china might think if you want to do this thing where you are in the international you're in the world you're making movies you want other countries to see this movie that you can't push that agenda so much
get i didn't think it was a great movie that was probably the only thing that i've seen
that's a i could see is kind of off putting for people who decides that tunnel were all great movie i loved it it's doubly worth going in seeing what's even in the movie theater and that the guy who's here today
and but if i would say like
our lives and ride and how good it is
two hundred
