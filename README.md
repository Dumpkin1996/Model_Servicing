# Model_Servicing
Implementation of chains of ML Models linked with RPC with possible real-life applications.

Current Stage: Only 2 Models, one audio-transcriber and one sentimental-analyzer.

For audio-transcriber, we use CMU-pcoketsphnix. Installation guide on Mac OS can be found [here](https://github.com/watsonbox/homebrew-cmu-sphinx).
